# Reflection
This game was a 2 week long project I took up in my free time to demonstrate and further improve my python skills. One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning the pygame library from scratch. This project was a great learning experience as it helped me deepen my understanding of python programming. I had intended on creating an executable file for the game so that accessing the game wouldnt require opening the python file but I could not get the pyinstaller module to work.
